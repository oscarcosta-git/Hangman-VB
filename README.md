# Hangman-VB
A simple Hangman game developed in Visual Basic as part of a Year 11 Software Design and Development course. This project was created to demonstrate core programming concepts such as string manipulation, control structures, user input handling, and basic GUI design.

The game allows players to guess a hidden word, with incorrect guesses gradually revealing parts of a hangman figure. Includes features like input validation, win/lose detection, and a basic UI.
