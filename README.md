# Hangman-VB
A classic Hangman game built in Visual Basic in 2023 as part of a Year 11 Software Design and Development course.

This project demonstrates core programming concepts, including:

- String manipulation
- Control structures and loops
- User input handling
- Basic GUI design using Windows Forms

Players must guess a hidden word, with each incorrect guess revealing a part of the hangman figure. The game includes input validation, win/lose detection, and a simple, user-friendly interface.
